I use tools like: CSS Minifier and JSCompress.
When using React, your code gets automatically minified by webpack when you create a production build.

5. Write 3 methods to reduce the page’s load time.

3) Lazy Loading
4) Leverage a content delivery network (CDN).


6. Do you use any CSS preprocessor? If yes, describe what do you like about preprocessors and what you don’t.
I used SASS quite a lot in the past.
PROS:
- Create reusable code snippets that can be imported
- Makes code more organized, clean and helps avoid repetitions

CONS:
- Compilation takes longer time
- They can produce very large CSS files


7. How do you include a non standard font in a website?
Inside our .css file we can import non standard font like this:
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: "My Custom Font";
    src: url(http://www.example.org/mycustomfont.ttf) format("truetype");
}
```
