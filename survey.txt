QUESTIONS

1. Which browser and which tools do you usually use to develop? (Operating system, browser, various tools).
- Browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla FireFox
- Operating System : MacOS, Linux
- Code Editor: VS Code
- Api Testing: POSTMAN
- Containers Handling: Kubernetes and OpenShift

2. How do you optimize assets? (CSS, Js, Images).
I use tools like CSS Minifier and JSCompress to optimize CSS and JavaScript.
For Images we could use a CDN to serve them and we can also compress the images so that we can reduce their size.
When using React, your code gets automatically minified by webpack when you create a production build.
    
3. Why a website usually serves assets from different domains?
It's because browsers usually have limits on the number of concurrent downloads from a domain at a moment. 
So, serving assets from multiple domains can increase the concurrent level.

4. Which new technology would you like to learn during this year?
I would learn the Microsoft stack, specifically ASP.NET CORE and C#. I would also learn more about VueJS.
5. Write 3 methods to reduce the page’s load time.

1) Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML.
2) Cache your web pages.
3) Lazy Loading
4) Leverage a content delivery network (CDN).


6. Do you use any CSS preprocessor? If yes, describe what do you like about preprocessors and what you don’t.
I used SASS quite a lot in the past.
PROS:
- Create reusable code snippets that can be imported
- Makes code more organized, clean and helps avoid repetitions

CONS:
- Compilation takes longer time
- They can produce very large CSS files


7. How do you include a non standard font in a website?
Inside our .css file we can import non standard font like this:
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: "My Custom Font";
    src: url(http://www.example.org/mycustomfont.ttf) format("truetype");
}
```
